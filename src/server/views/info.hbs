    <h2>

        A payments system where users could register, add(generate) cards, deposit funds from cards to their user/client
        accounts and transfer funds between each other.

    </h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Guests do not have access to services.</li>
        <li>Registered users have their own unique customerId generated with which they can transact with other users.
        </li>
        <li>Registered users can add cards (it is a mocking service, not a real credit card) - they are being
            automatically generated.</li>
        <li>Assuming the cards are real and always with positive balances - users can deposit funds to their
            user/customer accounts.</li>
        <li>If user has enough balance on the account, they could transfer funds to another user/customer accounts.</li>
        <li>User view all related transactions separated in two tables:
            <ul>
                <li>received transactions;</li>
                <li>sent transactions;</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Users can not transfer zero or negative amounts - both for deposits and transactions.</li>
        <li>User authentication through json web token (jwt) which is being signed and sent after user login;</li>
    </ul>
